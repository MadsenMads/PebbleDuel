# PebbleDuel

Ultimate Duel is a very simple social game.

You gather a group of people, and everybody loads up the app, and goes to the fight screen at the same time.

The watch now registers any movement, and you are deemed "dead" if it is shaken too much.

The object of the game is to be the last man standing, by forcing your friends to shake their watch, while being careful not to shake your own.
